# Conversions Tool

[Live Page](https://esdidubs.github.io/con/)

This tool allows the user to convert measurements for height, weight, and
volume. It includes traditional units, such as centimeters, meters, and miles;
however, it also includes fun comparisons like famous buildings and celebrities.
This is the only tool I'm aware of that will let you know that 
1 Statue of Liberty is equal to 51.5493 Brad Pitts.
